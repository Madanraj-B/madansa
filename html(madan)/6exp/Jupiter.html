        Jupiter is the largest planet in our Solar System, known for its massive size, strong magnetic field, and distinctive bands of clouds. Here are some key facts about it:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Size and Composition
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Jupiter is a gas giant, made primarily of hydrogen and helium.</li>
                <li>It has a diameter of about 139,820 kilometers (86,881 miles) — roughly 11 times that of Earth.</li>
                <li>Jupiter’s mass is about 318 times that of Earth, and its volume could contain over 1,300 Earths.</li>

            </ul>
            <li>Atmosphere</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Jupiter's atmosphere is characterized by bands of clouds at different altitudes, including the famous Great Red Spot, a massive storm that has been raging for at least 400 years.</li>
                <li>The atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium, with traces of methane, water vapor, and ammonia.</li>

            </ul>
            <li> Moons</li>
            <ul><li>Jupiter has at least 95 known moons, including Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. These four were discovered by Galileo in 1610 and are some of the largest moons in the Solar System.</li>
                 <li>Europa is particularly interesting for its subsurface ocean, which may have conditions suitable for life.</li>

            </ul>
            <li>Magnetic Field</li>
            <ul><li>Jupiter has the strongest magnetic field of any planet in the Solar System, 14 times stronger than Earth's. This magnetic field generates powerful radiation belts around the planet.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Rings</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Jupiter has a faint ring system, discovered in 1979 by the Voyager spacecraft. These rings are made primarily of dust particles and are very difficult to see.</li>

            </ul>
        </ol>
