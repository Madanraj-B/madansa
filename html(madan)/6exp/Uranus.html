    <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun in our solar system and is known for its unique features and characteristics. Here are some key facts about it:
        <ol>
            <li>Size and Composition</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Uranus is a gas giant and is the third-largest planet in the solar system by diameter (after Jupiter and Saturn). It has a diameter of about 50,724 kilometers (31,518 miles).</li>
                <li>Its composition is mostly made up of hydrogen, helium, and methane. Methane gives Uranus its characteristic blue-green color, as it absorbs red light and reflects blue and green wavelengths.</li>

            </ul>
            <li>Tilt and Rotation:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Uranus is famous for its extreme axial tiltâ€”about 98 degrees. This means the planet essentially rotates on its side, unlike other planets in the solar system. This tilt gives Uranus extreme seasonal variations.</li>
                <li>A day on Uranus (one full rotation) lasts about 17 hours and 14 minutes, and a year (one orbit around the Sun) takes about 84 Earth years.</li>

            </ul>
            <li>Atmosphere:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The atmosphere of Uranus is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of methane and other hydrocarbons. Methane is responsible for the planet's blue color.</li>
                <li>Uranus has very strong winds and weather patterns. Winds can reach speeds of up to 900 km/h (560 mph) in some regions, and the planet experiences significant temperature variations.</li>

            </ul>
            <li>Rings:</li>
            <ul><li>
                Uranus has a system of 13 known rings. These rings are faint and made mostly of dark, icy particles. They are much less prominent than the rings of Saturn, but still intriguing.
            </li>

        </ul>
        <li> Moons:</li>
        <ul><li>Uranus has 27 known moons. Some of the largest include Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. These moons have varied geological features, ranging from icy surfaces to craters and valleys.</li></ul>
