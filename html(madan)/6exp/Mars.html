        Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is often called the "Red Planet" due to its reddish appearance, which is caused by iron oxide (rust) on its surface. It's a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, composed primarily of carbon dioxide, and it has surface features reminiscent of both the Moon and Earth, including valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps.

Here are some key facts about Mars:
<ol>
    <li>Size and Structure</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Mars has about half the diameter of Earth.</li>
        <li>It has a similar day length (24.6 hours) but a year on Mars is about 687 Earth days, nearly twice as long.</li>
        <li>The planet has a cold, dry surface with an average temperature of about -80°F (-60°C), though it can vary greatly.</li>

    </ul>
<li> Surface Features</li>
<ul>
    <li>Mars has the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, which is about 13.6 miles (22 km) high—almost three times the height of Mount Everest.</li>
    <li>The Valles Marineris is a canyon system that stretches over 2,500 miles (4,000 km) and is up to 7 miles (11 km) deep.</li>
    <li>There are signs of ancient riverbeds, indicating that liquid water once flowed on the surface, although Mars is dry today.</li>
</ul>
<li> Moons</li>
<ul>
    <li>Mars has two small, irregularly shaped moons, Phobos and Deimos. They are thought to be captured asteroids from the asteroid belt.</li>

</ul>
<li>Water on Mars</li>
<ul>
    <li>Evidence suggests Mars had liquid water in the past, and scientists believe that water may still exist in the form of ice, particularly at the poles or in underground reservoirs.</li>
    <li>Recent discoveries from missions like NASA’s Perseverance Rover and Curiosity Rover have shown signs of ancient lakes and rivers.</li>

</ul>
