Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system. It's a gas giant, similar to Uranus, and is composed mostly of hydrogen, helium, and water, along with traces of methane and ammonia. This gives Neptune its striking blue color, as methane absorbs red light and reflects blue.

Here are some key facts about Neptune:
<ol>
    <li> Size and Composition:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Diameter: About 49,244 kilometers (30,598 miles), making it almost four times the diameter of Earth.</li>
        <li>Mass: Neptune is 17 times as massive as Earth.</li>
        <li>Atmosphere: Primarily composed of hydrogen, helium, and methane. The presence of methane contributes to its blue appearance.</li>
        <li>Core: Likely made of rock and ice, surrounded by a thick atmosphere and deep layers of gas.</li>

    </ul>
    <li>Moons and Rings:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Neptune has 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest and most notable. Triton is unique because it orbits Neptune in the opposite direction to the planet's rotation, suggesting it may have been captured by Neptune’s gravity.</li>
        <li>Neptune also has a faint ring system, consisting of five known rings. These are made of dust and ice particles.</li>

    </ul>
    <li> Climate and Weather:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Neptune is known for its extreme weather, with winds reaching speeds of up to 2,100 kilometers per hour (1,300 miles per hour), the fastest in the solar system.</li>
        <li>The planet has large storm systems, including the Great Dark Spot, which was similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot. This storm system was observed by NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1989, though it appears to have disappeared by the time of later observations.</li>
        <li>Neptune's temperature is extremely cold, averaging around -214°C (-353°F).</li>

    </ul>
    <li>Orbit and Rotation:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Neptune takes about 165 Earth years to orbit the Sun, making a year on Neptune extremely long.</li>
        <li>It has a relatively short day, rotating once every 16 hours.</li>
        <li>The planet is tilted on its axis by about 28 degrees, which is similar to Earth’s tilt, giving it seasons that vary in length due to its long orbital period.</li>

    </ul>
    <li> Discovery and Exploration:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Neptune was discovered in 1846 by astronomers Johann Galle and Heinrich d'Arrest based on mathematical predictions made by Urbain Le Verrier. It was the first planet to be discovered through mathematical prediction rather than direct observation.</li>
        <li>The only spacecraft to visit Neptune so far is NASA's Voyager 2, which flew by the planet in 1989. This flyby provided us with the first close-up images of the planet and its moons.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
