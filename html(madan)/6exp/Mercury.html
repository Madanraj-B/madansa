                Mercury is a chemical element with the symbol Hg and atomic number 80. It is a heavy, silvery-white liquid metal at room temperature and is the only metal that is liquid under standard conditions. Here’s an overview of key aspects of mercury:
            </li>
            <li>
                Physical and Chemical Properties:
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Appearance: Mercury is a shiny, metallic liquid with a silvery appearance. It forms droplets at room temperature.</li>
                <li>Density: It is dense, about 13.6 times denser than water.</li>
                <li>Melting Point: Mercury has a low melting point of −38.83°C (−37.89°F).</li>
                <li>Boiling Point: Its boiling point is 356.7°C (674°F)</li>
                <li>Conductivity: It is a good conductor of electricity and heat, though not as efficient as other metals like copper.</li>
                <li>Toxicity: Mercury is highly toxic, especially in its vapor form or as methylmercury (a more toxic organic compound), which can accumulate in living organisms.</li>
            </ul>
            <li> Occurrence and Sources:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Natural Occurrence: Mercury is primarily found in the mineral cinnabar (mercury sulfide, HgS), which is the main ore from which mercury is extracted.</li>
                <li>Distribution: It occurs in trace amounts in the Earth's crust, and small amounts can be found in rocks, soil, and water.</li>
                <li>Man-made Sources: Mercury can also be released into the environment from industrial activities such as coal burning, mining, and the production of chlorine and caustic soda</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Historical Use:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Mercury has been known since ancient times and was used by the ancient Egyptians and Romans.</li>
                <li>It has been used in thermometers, barometers, and various other scientific instruments.</li>
                <li>Historically, mercury was also used in gold mining (amalgamation) and in some medicines (though this is now discouraged due to its toxicity).</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
