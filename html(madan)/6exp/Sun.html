    <p>The Sun is the star at the center of our solar system and is the most important source of light and energy for life on Earth. It plays a critical role in the functioning of the solar system and life on our planet. Here's an overview of the Sun from various perspectives:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Astronomical Overview</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Type of Star: The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G dwarf star) in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, which means it is a medium-sized star that is in the "main sequence" phase of its life cycle.</li>
            <li>Composition: The Sun is primarily composed of hydrogen (about 75%) and helium (about 24%), with trace amounts of heavier elements like oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.</li>
            <li>Size and Mass: The Sun's diameter is approximately 1.39 million kilometers (about 109 times that of Earth). Its mass is about 330,000 times the mass of Earth, making up about 99.86% of the total mass of the solar system.</li>
            <li>Distance from Earth: The Sun is approximately 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from Earth, a distance called 1 Astronomical Unit (AU).</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Structure of the Sun</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The Sun has several layers, each with distinct properties:
                <ol><li>Core:</li>
                <ul><li>The innermost part of the Sun, where nuclear fusion occurs.</li>
                <li>The temperature in the core is estimated to be about 15 million degrees Celsius.</li>
            <li>Fusion in the core converts hydrogen into helium, releasing vast amounts of energy that powers the Sun and emits light and heat.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Radiative Zone</li>
        <ul><li>Surrounding the core, the radiative zone extends outward about 70% of the Sunâ€™s radius.</li>
        <li>Energy produced in the core travels outward in the form of radiation (photons) but takes thousands to millions of years to reach the surface due to constant absorption and re-emission by particles.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Convective Zone:</li>
    <ul><li>The outer layer of the Sun, extending from about 70% to 100% of its radius.</li>
    <li>In this zone, energy is transferred by convection, meaning hot plasma rises toward the surface, cools, and sinks again in a cycle, creating solar convection cells.</li>
</ul>
    </ol>
            </li>           
        </ul>
        <li> Solar Energy and Its Importance</li>
        <ul><li>Nuclear Fusion: The Sun produces energy through nuclear fusion, which occurs in its core. In this process, hydrogen nuclei (protons) fuse to form helium, releasing energy in the form of light and heat. This energy travels through the Sun and is emitted into space, some of which reaches Earth.</li>
        <li>Solar Energy on Earth: The energy from the Sun drives most processes on Earth, including:
            Photosynthesis: Plants convert sunlight into energy, supporting almost all life forms.
            Weather and Climate: Solar radiation drives atmospheric processes and ocean currents, influencing weather patterns and climate.
            Solar Power: Humans have harnessed sunlight through solar panels to generate electricity.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Solar Phenomena</li>
        <ul><li>Sunspots: These are cooler, darker areas on the Sun's surface caused by magnetic activity. Sunspots often appear in cycles, peaking every 11 years in what's known as the solar cycle.
            Solar Flares: Sudden, intense bursts of energy and radiation from the Sun's surface. They can impact Earth's magnetosphere and communications systems.
            Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs): Large eruptions of solar material and magnetic fields that can affect satellites, power grids, and even astronauts in space.
            Solar Wind: A continuous stream of charged particles emitted from the corona, influencing space weather and interacting with Earth's magnetic field, sometimes causing auroras.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
