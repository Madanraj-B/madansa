            Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known planet in the universe that supports life. Here are some key details about Earth:
            <ol>
                <li>Basic Facts</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Distance from the Sun: About 93 million miles (150 million kilometers).</li>
                    <li>Diameter: Approximately 7,917.5 miles (12,742 kilometers) at the equator.</li>
                    <li>Circumference: Roughly 24,901 miles (40,075 kilometers).</li>
                    <li>Surface Area: About 196.9 million square miles (510.1 million square kilometers).</li>
                    <li>Mass: 5.97 × 10²⁴ kg.</li>
                    <li>Average Temperature: Varies widely, but the global average is around 59°F (15°C).</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Composition and Structure</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Crust: The outermost solid layer where we live. It's made of rock and is divided into tectonic plates.</li>
                    <li>Mantle: Beneath the crust, made of semi-solid rock, which flows slowly over time. It's responsible for Earth's internal heat</li>
                    <li>Outer Core: A layer of liquid iron and nickel, which generates Earth's magnetic field.</li>
                    <li>Inner Core: A solid ball of iron and nickel, the hottest part of Earth, with temperatures reaching up to 9,000°F (5,000°C).</li>
                </ul>
                <li> Atmosphere</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nitrogen: 78%</li>
                    <li>Oxygen: 21%</li>
                    <li>Argon: 0.93%</li>
                    <li>Carbon Dioxide: 0.04% (but increasing due to human activities)</li>
                    <li>Other gases: Including neon, helium, and methane</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Water and Oceans</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Earth's surface is about 71% water, with the vast majority being ocean (around 96.5%).</li>
                    <li>The remaining 3.5% is fresh water, found mostly in glaciers, ice caps, and underground reservoirs.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
