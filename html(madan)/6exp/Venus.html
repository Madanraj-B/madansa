        <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often referred to as Earth's "sister planet" due to its similar size, composition, and proximity. However, despite these similarities, Venus has very different environmental conditions. Here's an overview of Venus:</p>
        <ol><li>Basic Facts:</li>
        <ul><li>Diameter: 12,104 km (7,521 miles), just a bit smaller than Earth (12,742 km).</li>
        <li>Mass: About 81.5% of Earth's mass</li>
    <li>Orbit: Venus orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 108 million kilometers (67 million miles), completing a full orbit in about 225 Earth days.</li>
<li>Rotation: Venus has a very slow rotation, taking about 243 Earth days to complete one full rotation. Interestingly, it rotates in the opposite direction to most planets, including Earth (retrograde rotation). This means the Sun would rise in the west and set in the east on Venus.</li>
<li>Day length: A day on Venus (one rotation) is longer than a year (one orbit around the Sun), which is why it's often said that a day on Venus is longer than its year.</li>
</ul>
<li>Atmosphere:
</li>
<ul><li>The atmosphere of Venus is thick, dense, and composed mostly of carbon dioxide (96.5%), with clouds of sulfuric acid. This thick atmosphere causes an extreme greenhouse effect, trapping heat and raising surface temperatures.</li>
<li>Surface temperature: The surface of Venus is incredibly hot, averaging around 465°C (869°F), which is hotter than Mercury, despite Venus being farther from the Sun. The high temperature is due to the extreme greenhouse effect caused by the thick atmosphere.</li>
<li>Atmospheric pressure: The pressure at the surface of Venus is about 92 times that of Earth—equivalent to the pressure found 900 meters (about 3,000 feet) underwater on Earth.</li>
</ul>
<li>Surface and Geology:</li>
<ul><li>Volcanic Activity: Venus is thought to have many large volcanoes, some of which may still be active. These include shield volcanoes similar to those on Earth, though there is no definitive proof of recent eruptions.</li>
<li>Highlands and Plains: The surface of Venus is a mix of highland regions, such as Ishtar Terra, and vast, flat plains, like the Lowland regions. Most of the surface is relatively young, about 300 to 500 million years old, suggesting that Venus may have experienced some form of resurfacing in the past.</li>
<li>Impact Craters: Venus has fewer craters than the Moon or Mercury, likely because volcanic activity and the planet's dense atmosphere have erased or buried older craters over time</li>
</ul>
<li>Interesting Facts:</li>
<ul><li>No moons: Venus has no natural satellites, unlike Earth or Mars.</li>
<li>Retrograde Rotation: Venus rotates in the opposite direction to most planets in the solar system (including Earth). This means if you stood on the surface, the Sun would appear to rise in the west and set in the east.</li>
<li>Possibility of Life: Despite its extreme conditions, there has been some speculation about the potential for microbial life in Venus' upper atmosphere, where temperatures and pressures are more Earth-like. In 2020, scientists suggested the possible detection of phosphine—a chemical often associated with life—in Venus' clouds, though this finding is still debated.</li>
